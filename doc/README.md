## Accessing the Booking System

1. Open the **Co-working Space Booking System** website in your browser.
2. The homepage presents you with options to **select a desk**, **book a desk**, and view **summary** and **dashboard** sections.

---

## Booking Desks

To book a desk, follow these steps:

1. **Select Desk Type**: On the main screen, you’ll see available desks categorized as **Individual Desks** or **Team Desks**. Desks are color-coded:
   - **Green**: Available for booking.
   - **Red**: Already booked.

2. **Choose Booking Options**:
   - In the **Booking Form** section, you’ll be asked to select:
     - **Desk Type**: Choose either *Individual* or *Team* desk.
     - **Membership Tier**: Choose from *Basic*, *Premium*, or *Executive* (for individual desks only).
     - **Duration**: Specify the number of hours you want to book (1–8 hours).

3. **Book the Desk**: Click the **Book Desk** button. Once booked, a summary of your booking with the total cost will be displayed.

### Booking Restrictions
- **Double Booking Prevention**: Desks already booked appear in red and cannot be selected again until the booking period ends.

## Understanding Membership Tiers

The system offers three membership tiers, each with a different hourly rate for individual desks:

1. **Basic**: $10 per hour
2. **Premium**: $15 per hour
3. **Executive**: $20 per hour

### Team Desk Rates
- The rate for booking team desks is fixed at $25 per hour, regardless of membership tier.

---

## Applying Discounts

Our system provides a **10% discount** on bookings of **more than 3 hours**. The discount is automatically applied to your booking total if the duration exceeds three hours.

**Example**: 
- If a Premium member books an individual desk for 4 hours, the standard total would be $15 * 4 = $60. With the 10% discount, the final cost will be $60 - $6 = $54.

---

## Booking Summary

After booking a desk, a **Booking Summary** will appear, showing:
- The desk number you booked (e.g., *I1* for Individual Desk 1 or *T1* for Team Desk 1).
- The membership tier selected.
- The number of hours booked.
- The total amount charged, including any applicable discounts.

This summary allows you to quickly review the booking details before payment.

## Revenue Dashboard (For Administrators)

Administrators can view the **Revenue Dashboard**, which provides an overview of total revenue collected from bookings across each membership tier and team bookings. This dashboard is helpful for tracking earnings and understanding booking trends within the co-working space.

---

## Payment Options (Future Feature)

Currently, this system does not have an integrated payment solution. However, we are exploring the following options for future releases:

1. **Credit Card Payment Integration**: Secure credit card payments directly through the website, enabling users to complete their booking and payment in one seamless flow.

2. **Digital Wallets**: Supporting payment methods such as **Apple Pay**, **Google Wallet**, and **Samsung Pay** to accommodate mobile and online transactions.

3. **Bank Transfer**: Providing an option for bank transfers for members who prefer traditional payment methods.

4. **Subscription Plans**: Offering monthly subscriptions for regular users, potentially tied to membership tiers (e.g., a monthly Premium membership with discounted hourly rates).

Once payment options are integrated, users will be guided through a secure checkout process after selecting their booking options and confirming the total cost.
