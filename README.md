## Project Title: A Co-working Space Booking System with Membership Tiers and Discounts

Design a co-working space booking system using HTML, CSS, and Javascript(Vanilla javascript or framework of your choice), The co-working space has 15 desks, with 10 desks suitable for individual work and the remaining 5 desks suitable for team collaboration. The booking system should allow users to book desks for a specified time period.

For individual desks, there are three membership tiers: Basic, Premium, and Executive. Basic members pay $10 per hour, Premium members pay $15 per hour, and Executive members pay $20 per hour.

For team desks, the price is fixed at $25 per hour. (Please use a local currency equivalent if you prefer to do so)


Users booking for more than 3 hours get a 10% discount on the total amount.

Your solution should visually represent the booking mechanism, marking desks as booked once reserved, preventing double bookings. Upon booking, display the total charged.

As an addition, you may display a dashboard showing the total revenue collected over a certain period, categorized by membership tiers. (This is not a core requirement, but it is nice to have).
